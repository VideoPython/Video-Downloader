# Video-Downloader
Download Videos/Streams/Media and convert it with ffmpeg in your desired format

If you want to download a video/stream this is your programm, it allows you to shedule the download of multiple videos or record a livestream.
This programm is directed at videos and stream that are loaded/streamed in small segments.
It needs your manual input for the source and a title but works automatically for everything else once started.

The programm is designed for Windows and Python, I tested it with version 3.10 of Python.
For information on how to use it check the readme in the folder with the Python programm.

How you use this programm is up to you and I will not be responsible for it. You may configure the programm freely, for the ffmpeg files act corresponding to their license.

Have fun
